# #dict comp workflow:
# #1. Iterate over the list of files in the directory; put the filename in the vairable "filename"
# #for filename in os.listdir(dirname)  --> {filename: }

# #2. For each file, run find_longest_word() function and pass in filename as the arg.
# #The return value is a string -- the longest string in teh file

# #3. Each filename and the longest-word combination becomes a k, v pair
