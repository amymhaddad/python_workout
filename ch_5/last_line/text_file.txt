It’s very common for new Python programmers to learn how they can iterate over the lines of a file, printing one line at a time. 
But what if I’m not interested in each line, or even in most of the lines? And what about numbers, like 12, 13, and 14?
What if I’m only interested in a single line—the final line of the file? 
Can you get practice reading in numbers, like 100 and 25? Try it. And add 200 to the list, too.
This is the last line.
