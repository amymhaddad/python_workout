# Write a dictionary to a CSV file. Each line in the CSV file should be: (1) the key, which weâ€™ll assume to be a string, (2) the value, (3) the type of the value (e.g., str or int).

import csv

    writer.writeheader()
    for key, value in letters_and_numbers.items():
        writer.writerow({fieldnames[0]: key, fieldnames[1]: type(value)})
