For this exercise, you need to write a program that takes a hex number and returns the decimal equivalent. 
That is, if the user enters 50, then we will assume that it is a hex number (equal to 0x50), and will print the value 80 on the screen. 
And no, you shouldnâ€™t convert the number all at once using the int function, although it is permissible to use int one digit at a time.
