Start with a list, mylist, which contains any number of elements, of any type. You want to modify this list, such that it contains six elements, each of which is the letter a. For example:

mylist = list(range(10))
alias = mylist

# DO SOMETHING HERE

print(mylist)  # prints ['a','a','a','a','a','a']
print(alias)   # prints ['a','a','a','a','a','a']
