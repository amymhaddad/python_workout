Translate a given sentence into pig latin.

If the word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), then add way to the end of the word. So air becomes airway and eat becomes eatway.

If the word begins with any other letter, then we take the first letter, put it on the end of the word, and then add ay. Thus, python becomes ythonpay and computer becomes omputercay. You don't need to account for capitalization or puncuation.
