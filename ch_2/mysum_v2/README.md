This challenge asks you to redefine mysum, such that it can take any number of arguments. The arguments must all be of the same type and know how to respond to the + operator. (Thus, the function should work with numbers, strings, lists, and tuples, but not with sets and dictionaries.)

The result should be a new, longer sequence of the type provided by the parameters. Thus, the result of mysum('abc', 'def') will be the string abcdef, and the result of mysum([1,2,3], [4,5,6]) will be the six-element list [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Of course, it should also still return the integer 6 if we invoke mysum(1,2,3).
