Here, you’ll implement a translator from English into another secret children’s language, Ubbi Dubbi.

In Ubbi Dubbi, every vowel (a, e, i, o, or u) is prefaced with ub. Thus milk becomes mubilk (m-ub-ilk) and program becomes prubogrubam (prub-ogrub-am). In theory, you only put an ub before every vowel sound, rather than before each vowel. 

You’ll translate a word from English into Ubbi Dubbi. So if the user enters octopus, you’ll output uboctubopubus. And if the user enters elephant, you’ll output ubelubephubant. When you do have two vowels next to one another, preface each of them with ub. Thus, soap will become suboubap.

Handle capitalized words: If a word is capitalized (i.e., the first letter is capitalized, but the rest of the word isn’t), then the Ubbi Dubbi translation should be similarly capitalized.
