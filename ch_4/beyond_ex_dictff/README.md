Exercise 1:
The dict.update method merges two dicts. Write a function that takes any number of dicts, and returns a dictionary that reflects the combination of all of them. If the same key appears in more than one dictionary, then the most recently merged dictâ€™s value should appear in the output.

Exercise 2:
Write a function that takes any even number of arguments and returns a dict based on them. The even-indexed arguments become the dict keys, while the odd-numbered arguments become the dict values. Thus, calling the function with the arguments ('a', 1, 'b', 2) will result in the dict {'a':1, 'b':2} being returned.

Exercise 3:
Write a function, dict_partition, that takes one dictionary (d) and a function (f) as arguments. dict_partition will return two dictionaries,each containing key-value pairs from d. The decision regarding where to put each of the key-value pairs will be made according to the output from f, which will be run on each key-value pair in d. If f returns True, then the key-value pair will be put in the first output dict. If f returns False, then the key-value pair will be put in the second output dict.
