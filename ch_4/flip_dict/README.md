Imagine a dict in which the keys are usernames and the values are user ID numbers; it might be useful to flip that, so that you can search by ID number.

To do this exercise, first create a dictionary of any size, in which the keys are unique and the values are also unique. (A key may appear as a value, or vice versa.) For example:

d = {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3}

You are to turn the dictionary inside out, such that the keys and the values are reversed.
